## What you will build ##

Weave allows you to focus on developing your application, rather than your infrastructure.

In this example we will demonstrate how Weave allows you to quickly and easily deploy a
simple load balancing solution using Weave and WeaveDNS, with no modifications to your
application and minimal docker knowledge.

We will run a very simple go based rest server which shows the IP address of each container
to demonstrate our use of round robin DNS.

## What you will use ##

* [Weave](http://weave.works)
* [Docker](http://docker.com)
* [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com)
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## What you will need to complete this guide ##

This getting started guide is self contained. You will use Weave, Docker and Ubuntu, and we make use of VirtualBox and Vagrant to allow you to run this entire getting started guide on your personal system.

* 15 minutes
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [VirtualBox > 4.3.20](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Vagrant > 1.6](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)

## What you will do ##

You will use Weave to

* Load balance six containers across three hosts on a Weave network

## Configuring and setting up your hosts ##

All of the code for this example is available on [github](http://github.com/weaveworks/buides), and you first clone the getting started repository.

    git clone http://github.com/weaveworks/guides

You will use Vagrant to setup and configure two Ubuntu hosts and install Docker. We make use of Vagrant's functionality to download the base docker images we will be using, and we then install Weave. If you would like to work through the installation steps please review our [getting started guide](https://github.com/fintanr/weave-gs/blob/master/ubuntu-simple/README.md) for a more manual example.

    cd guides/weave-loadbalance
    vagrant up

Vagrant will pull down and configure an Ubuntu image, this may take a few minutes depending on the speed of your network connection. For more details on Vagrant please refer to the [Vagrant documentation](http://vagrantup.com). If you are thinking about a cup of coffee, now may be a good point to get one.

Once the setup of the hosts is complete you can check their status with

    vagrant status

The IP addresses we use for this demo are

    172.17.8.101    weave-gs-01
    172.17.8.102    weave-gs-02

## Introducing WeaveDNS ##

[WeaveDNS](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html) answers name queries in a Weave network. WeaveDNS provides a simple way for containers to find each other: just give them hostnames and tell other containers to connect to those names.

## Introducting Weave Automatic IP Address Management ##

[Weave Automatic IP Address Management (IPAM)](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/ipam.html) automatically assigns containers IP addresses that are unique across the network. Weave IPAM allows you to easily add more containers
to your network and takes care of ensuring each container has a unique IP so you don't have too.

## Launching Weave for our example ##

In order to start our example we first first lauch Weave and WeaveDNS on all of our hosts. Take note of the `-iprange` option we pass to Weave, which enables Weaves Automatic IP Address Management (IPAM) functionality on a specific subnet.

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
    weave launch -iprange 10.2.0.1/16

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-02
    weave launch -iprange 10.2.0.1/16 172.17.8.101

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
    weave launch-dns; weave launch-proxy

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-02
    weave launch-dns; weave launch-proxy

Alternatively you can use the script `setup-weave.sh`.

## What has happened ##

At this point you have launched Weave on all your hosts, and created an overlay network which also provides DNS.

Logging into any of the hosts and typing `weave status` will give you output similar to below

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
    weave status

## Launching our Containers ##

Next we launch our containers on each host. Our containers contain a very simple rest server
which will return the ip address of the containers on the Weave network.

As we have enabled both WeaveDNS and Weaves Automatic IP Address Management we only need to provide
the name of our container and the hostname we wish to use. You will notice that we use the same
hostname on each container. WeaveDNS automatically detects this DNS requests

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
    eval $(weave proxy-env)
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-02
    eval $(weave proxy-env)
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch
    docker run -d -h lb.weave.local fintanr/myip-scratch

Alternatively you can use the script `launch-demo-containers.sh` to launch.

## What has happened ##

At this point you have launched six instances of our service, they have all
been allocated IP addresses and appear to other applications as a single endpoint.

## Connecting to your application ##

Next we will launch a container curl on the same network, and from there

    vagrant ssh weave-gs-01
    eval $(weave proxy-env)
    CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -ti -h ubuntu.weave.local fintanr/weave-gs-ubuntu-curl)
    docker exec -ti $CONTAINER "/bin/bash"

In this container lets connect to our endpoint, and make a request to our myip service.

    for i in `seq 1 20`; do curl lb.weave.local/myip; done

This will give you output such as

    root@81fc16c65cbd:/# for i in `seq 1 20`; do curl lb.weave.local/myip; done
    10.2.128.2
    fe80::9421:2bff:fec1:6d09
    
    10.2.128.2
    fe80::9421:2bff:fec1:6d09
    
    10.2.0.4
    fe80::4838:e2ff:fef1:246f
    
    10.2.128.3
    fe80::f0b0:1eff:fe57:f322
    
    10.2.128.3
    fe80::f0b0:1eff:fe57:f322
    
    10.2.0.2
    fe80::3c60:1fff:feee:644a
    ....

Note that your requests are balanced equally among all 6 containers you are running on both weave hosts (`10.2.0.x` are from `weave-gs-01`, and `10.2.128.x` are from `weave-gs-02`, that's how those agreed on splitting allocated IP range).

## Summary ##

You have used Weave and Docker to deploy a simple load balanced application.
